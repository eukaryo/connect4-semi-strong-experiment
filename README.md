# connect4-semi-strong-experiment

Experimental code for Connect Four (7x6) using a strong-solution probe (BDD tables), including
BFS-style layer expansion and alpha-beta–related scripts.

This repository contains:
- an upstream-derived probing implementation (with small local modifications), and
- additional experiment code written for the experiments in this repository.

The strong-solution data (BDD tables) is **not** bundled in this repository; it must be obtained
separately from Zenodo (see below).

## Reproducibility: how to run

1. Clone this repository locally.

2. Download the upstream archive from Zenodo:

- Zenodo record: https://zenodo.org/records/14582823  
- File: `strong_solution_w7_h6_archive.7z`

3. Extract it and place the directory `solution_w7_h6` at the repository root.

After this step, the following path must exist:

- `./solution_w7_h6`

Example (Linux):

```bash
# Download `strong_solution_w7_h6_archive.7z` from Zenodo (manual download is fine),
# then extract it:
7z x strong_solution_w7_h6_archive.7z

# Move/copy the extracted directory into the repo root:
# (adjust paths as needed)
cp -r solution_w7_h6 /path/to/connect4-semi-strong-experiment/
````

4. Build and run:

```bash
./compile_wdl.sh
./compile_and_run_experiment_bfs.sh
```

What these scripts do:

* `compile_wdl.sh` builds the probing binary (`wdl.out`).
* `compile_and_run_experiment_bfs.sh` compiles and runs `experiment-bfs.cpp` (OpenMP),
  then runs `alphabeta.py`.

Outputs:

* `output.csv` (generated by `experiment-bfs.out`)
* any additional stdout by `alphabeta.py`

## Notes

* You need `7z` (p7zip) to extract `strong_solution_w7_h6_archive.7z`.
* This code is intended for Linux.
* `experiment-bfs.cpp` is compiled with OpenMP (`-fopenmp`) via `compile_and_run_experiment_bfs.sh`.
* Running with the full strong-solution data may require a large-memory machine (on the order of 128 GB RAM).
